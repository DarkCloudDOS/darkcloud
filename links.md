> __Question to visitors:__
>
>I am thinking about modernizing my build setup, and be able to cross-compile DOS apps from Linux (or Windows or Mac) and use modern editors (for example Visual Studio code). Maybe implementing a multi-platform graphics library, that will let me code in my modern OS but still be compatible with DOS. 
> 
> I am also looking for a free (as in freedom + source code) DOS pascal compiler compatible with TP7.
