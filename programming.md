# Programming

Our site was boring... so we decided to have another page.
In this page you can find sources in pascal for you to download and enjoy.
There are some catergories. We hope that it is not that ugly. sorry. Real
programmers don't need comments... but if you need them just tell us

Seriously... I am thinking about modernizing my build setup, and be able to cross-compile DOS apps from Linux (or Windows or Mac) and use modern editors (for example Visual Studio code). Maybe implementing a multi-platform graphics library, that will let me code in my modern OS but still be compatible with DOS. 

I am also looking for a free (as in freedom + source code) DOS pascal compiler compatible with TP7.
