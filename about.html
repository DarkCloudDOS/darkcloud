<center><p>This is a story about three man. Ariel came first with a XT.
Then came Iftah with 386 (by that time Ariel had a 486 and Diego had no
computer). Then came Diego with a 486. Once upon a time, our three genius
minds met in an unknown <b><i>Israeli</i></b> highschool named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990203132822/http://horovitz.ort.org.il/">Ort
Horovitz.</a> There we learned Pascal and started to make our first program
- EQS : Equation Solver. Our school computer education was idiotic. So
we began learning street-programming (BBS's, friends and books) by ourselves.
The competition was hard, survivol was even harder.&nbsp;We fought side
to side against our parents and brothers. <b>We Have no official computer
education</b> but we still are great programmers. </p></center>
